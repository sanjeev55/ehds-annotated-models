Running check : UMLsec4ids Data Usage Control Check
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----IMPORTANT-------
To execute this Check successfully, the Initial Node and Final Node must have an empty name
Decision Nodes, Fork Nodes, Merge Nodes and Join Nodes must have an empty name
This is because they cannot be added to the permission tag

INFO: There is a decision node the diagram

There is a decision node within the diagram
If the obligation_stop follows the obligation_start in the same branch, then the check goes through.
If the obligation_start is before the decision node and the obligation_stop comes after the decision node, the check fails.
This is because the stop could be avoided.
Remember to put the obligation_stop in all branches in the diagram
----------------------------------------
If a prohibitted action is executed in any branch of the system, the Check fails as well.
There must not exist any possibility that an prohibitted action is executed.
----------------------------------------
If any branch of the system contains an action that is not permitted, the Check fail.
This is because there is a possibility that this action could be executed.

INFO: There is a fork node the diagram

There is a fork node within the diagram
The Check detects prohibitted actions that are executed.
It also detects actions that are executed but are not permitted.
If an obligation_start comes before the fork node and the obligation_stop comes after, the Check will not fail.
However there is the possibility that the check fails, if the obligation_start and obligation_stop both occur in the same parallelization.
